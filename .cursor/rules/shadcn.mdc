# shadcn/ui - Cursor Rules

## New UI Components

Use `@withsprinkles/shadcn-ui` for new UI components. `@withsprinkles/shadcn-ui` is a fork of `shadcn-ui` with fixes to accommodate Deno. Components can be installed as such (for example, for the accordion component):

```sh
deno task ui add accordion
```
